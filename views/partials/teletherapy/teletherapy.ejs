Both terms generally refer to talk therapy as distinguished from pharmacological, surgical, or other medical treatment.

Most of our providers are credentialed by several commercial insurance companies, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, United Healthcare (Optum Behavioral Health), Cigna, Aetna, Magellan Health, Humana Tricare, and many EAP organizations. For out-of-network treatment, we usually charge our standard fees at the time of service and ask that you contact your insurance company so that you can be reimbursed directly by them.</div>
