			<div class='technique-content'>
				<p>ADHD lasts into adulthood for at least one-third of children with ADHD. Treatments for adults can include medication, psychotherapy, education or training, or a combination of treatments.</p>

				<p>The best adult ADHD treatment strategies are multimodal ones â€” combinations of several different, complementary approaches that work together to reduce symptoms. For one person, this ideal combination may include medication, nutrition, exercise, and behavioral therapy. For someone else, it may mean taking supplements, participating in CBT, and joining an ADHD support group. Medication is often the first line of defense against the symptoms of ADHD for one simple reason: studies show it to be most effective. Medicine alone is not sufficient treatment for most adults with ADHD. This is especially true for adults struggling with work and day-to-day responsibilities. While medication works on a neurological level to regulate the brain, behavior therapy addresses specific problem behaviors by teaching the individual how to structure their time, establish predictability and routines, and increase positive outcomes. Behavior therapy can help change behavior through conditioning, which involves the following:</p>

				
					<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Creating an environment conducive to suitable behavior</li>
					<li>Providing positive feedback and reinforcement for acceptable behavior and improvement</li>
					<li>Establishing clear consequences for unwanted behavior, which may entail withholding reward/praise, or enforcing negative consequences</li>
					<li>Being consistent about expectations and consequences, both positive and negative</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<p>Tips:
				<ul>
					<li>Create a routine</li>
					<li>Manage distractions</li>
					<li>Limit choices</li>
					<li>Be clear and specific</li>
					<li>Design a plan</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

					<p>Modalities
					<ul>
					<li>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</li>
					<li>Parent Training in Behavior Management and Behavior Intervention in the Classroom (for children)</li>
					<li>Social Skills Training</li>
					<li>Support Groups</li>
					<li>Nutrition and Supplements</li>
					<li>Exercise</li>
					<li>Nature Therapy</li>
					<li>Brain Training</li>
