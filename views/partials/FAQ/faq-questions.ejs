						We use both terms interchangeably since the difference between the two are very subtle. Both terms generally refer to talk therapy as distinguished from pharmacological, surgical, or other medical treatment. However, psychotherapists may be inclined toward the exploration of past experiences and how those experiences contribute to your present day issues, whereas counselors may choose to work briefly on behaviors or targets specific symptoms or situations to offer guidance on how to deal with them.       </div>

						Counselors practice what is known as talk therapy and have a master's degree in mental health. Counselors can provide mental health diagnosis and develop treatment plans. Psychologist study behaviors, emotions and mental processes and hold a doctoral degree in psychology; they may provide treatment for chronic or acute problems. In contrast, psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in the study, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of emotional, mental, behavioral, and developmental issues.

						This is a difficult question to answer because it depends on many factors. Although we cannot make concrete promises about how long your treatment will last, we do know that your engagement, participation, effort, and commitment can have a significant impact on your progress. Yet, depending on the nature and severity of your symptoms, your support system and resilience, your openness, and the extent to which the treatment approach being use fits you, therapy might be relatively quick or not. You may hear one of your friends saying she was in therapy for a few short weeks while another one of your friends may say that he was in treatment for years.      </div>

						The short answer to this question is: when you see considerable symptom improvement. Statistically speaking, three out of four individuals who report improvement while in treatment will continue to do so a year after treatment has been completed. Nevertheless, one out of four of those who completed treatment for depression will return during the same year. Instead of focusing on ending treatment soon, perhaps more important it is that you build self-efficacy and resilience, both of which are qualities you will need to maintain your progress over time.      </div>
